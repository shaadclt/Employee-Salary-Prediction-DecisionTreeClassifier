# Employee Salary Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier

This project aims to predict the salary of employees based on various features using a decision tree classifier algorithm. By analyzing the provided dataset, the model can make accurate predictions if the salaries of new employees is above 100K or not.

This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build and train the decision tree classifier model for employee salary prediction.

## Features

- Decision Tree Classifier: The project utilizes the decision tree classifier algorithm, a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks, to predict the salary of employees.
- Feature Engineering: The dataset is preprocessed and features are engineered to ensure optimal performance of the model. This includes handling missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.
- Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Model Deployment: The trained model can be deployed in a production environment or integrated into an application to predict salaries based on input data.

## Technologies Used

- Python: The primary programming language used for building and training the decision tree classifier model.
- Scikit-learn: A popular machine learning library in Python used for implementing the decision tree classifier algorithm and performing model evaluation.
- Pandas: A data manipulation library used for data preprocessing and feature engineering tasks.
- NumPy: A library for numerical computations used for handling and manipulating numerical data.
